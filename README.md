No identity ;)

This is an experimental project for designing trusted collaborative
applications that are resilient to phishing attacks.


### Development

```
npm install
```

To watch while in development mode, type the following commands in two separate terminals. You will notice that every time you save a rust file, Tauri will automatically rebuild the application and restart it.

```
npm run watch
npm start 
```

To build the application with better debugging, try

```
npm run debug
```
